By day, I'm a backend web developer that's always trying to learn. And by night, I try to find time to play guitar, dabble in split keyboards, and play video games.

I started this site as a place for me to write down anything interesting I'm getting up to. Maybe someone else will find it interesting too.

Thanks for stopping by ✌️
